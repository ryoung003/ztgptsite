      <h1>Privacy Policy for ZeroTrace GPT</h1>
      <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-4">Effective Date: [Insert Date, e.g., October 26, 2023]</p>

      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Thank you for using ZeroTrace GPT ("the Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains our commitment to your privacy and how we handle information when you use our browser extension designed to manage your ChatGPT conversations locally.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-gray-800">1. No Data Collection</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700"><strong>ZeroTrace GPT is designed with privacy as its core principle. The Extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal data or your ChatGPT conversation data.</strong></p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">All functionalities, including sorting, filtering, exporting, and deleting your ChatGPT conversations, are performed entirely on your local computer, within your browser. No data is ever sent to any external servers, including our own.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-gray-800">2. How the Extension Works</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The Extension interacts with the ChatGPT web interface (chat.openai.com) locally on your browser to access and manage your conversation data. This interaction is limited to your device and browser session. The data is processed in-memory or uses your browser's local storage (if you choose to use features that require it, such as saving preferences) and is never transmitted externally.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-700 space-y-1 pl-4">
        <li><strong>Data Access:</strong> The Extension reads conversation data from the ChatGPT interface as it is displayed in your browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> All sorting, filtering, and preparation for export or deletion occur within your browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> If you export your conversations, they are saved directly to your local file system as per your action. The Extension itself does not retain copies of this data unless explicitly using a local browser storage feature for settings or cached data, which also remains on your device.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-gray-800">3. Permissions</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The Extension may require certain browser permissions to function correctly (e.g., to interact with the content of chat.openai.com pages or to download files to your computer upon your request). These permissions are solely used to enable the Extension's features on your local device and are not used to collect or transmit any data.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-gray-800">4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">ZeroTrace GPT does not integrate with any third-party services for data collection, analytics, or advertising. The only external interaction is with the ChatGPT website itself, which is initiated by your browser as part of its normal operation when you use ChatGPT.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-gray-800">5. Data Security</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Since no data is collected or transmitted by the Extension, the security of your data primarily relies on the security of your own computer and browser. We recommend keeping your browser and operating system updated.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-gray-800">6. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or a higher age if stipulated by local laws). We do not knowingly collect any information from children. Since the extension collects no data, this applies by default.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-gray-800">7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website or within the extension update notes).</p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Your continued use of the Extension after any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-gray-800">8. Contact Us</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the <a href="contact.html" class="text-green-600 hover:underline">Contact Page</a> on our website or directly at <a href="mailto:support@ztgpt.org" class="text-green-600 hover:underline">support@ztgpt.org</a>.</p>
